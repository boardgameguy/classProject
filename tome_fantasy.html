<h2>Hero Quest</h2>
<p><img src="https://boardgameguy.github.io/classProject/Images/hero.jpg" alt="Hero Quest" width="400" height="350"></p> 
<p>2-5 player game</p>
<p>recommended ages: 12+</p>
<p>estimated play time: 90 Min</p>
<p>Game pieces include 15 pieces of furniture, 21 doors, 64 playing cards, dice, and 35 miniatures</p>
<p>HeroQuest, sometimes written as Hero Quest, is an adventure board game. The game is loosely based around archetypes of 
fantasy role-playing games: the game itself is actually a game system, allowing the gamemaster 
(called "Morcar" and "Zargon" in the United Kingdom and North America respectively) to create dungeons 
of their own design using the provided game board, tiles, furnishings and figures. The game manual 
describes Morcar/Zargon as a former apprentice of Mentor, and the parchment text is read aloud from 
Mentor's perspective.</p>

<p>Players that play the heroes will assume the role of the strong Barbarian, the stubborn Dwarf, sly Elf, or the magical
wizard. They all have a different set of streangths and weaknesses. They must work together to complete each quest which
builds to a epic ending.</p>
