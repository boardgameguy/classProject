<dd>Games Workshop is a UK company that is big into miniature games. They are the ones that did Space Hulk,
Warhammer 40,000, and also do fantasy games like Lord of the Rings. On top of games and miniatures, they have
their own paint and terrain line.</dd>

<dd>Miniature market is a resource I use a lot! They are buying site for games that are played on the table.
Board games, mi nature games, and card games. They also have options for terrain and carrying cases to hold
your miniatureâ€™s in. Best of all, they have upcoming games shown so you can see what might interest you in the 
future.</dd>

<dd>Battle Systems is another UK company that made conservative priced terrain that is printed on cardboard.
It is a cheaper option than a lot of other terrain and it makes your battlespace look awesome! They have
terrain that is ancient, modern, and futuristic! They have even gone further with making their own game 
called Core Space.</dd>
