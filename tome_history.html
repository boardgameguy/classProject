<p>Civil War is now upon us, and you must take the field as the leader of the Union or 
the Confederate forces. Command your generals and direct your infantry, cavalry, and 
artillery in 30 different scenarios that feature the terrain and troop deployment of each

Gettysburg.</p>

<p>History may have been written, but in Battle Cry, the outcome of each battle is up 
to you. With your strategy and tactics, you can turn the tide to carry Old Glory or 
Dixie to victory.</p>
