<h2>How this Tomb works.</h2>
<p>Welcome to the tomb of games! You will find links next to this paragraph that will take you 
to games set in certain categories. Along with a photo, you will have the title, number of 
players, what game pieces there are, and a short overview of the game. The hope is to inform
you on different games you want to know about. Games will be added as time goes on. So, be
sure you come back and check periodically on your favorite categories.<p>
