<h2>Battleship</h2>
<p>2 player game</p><br><img src="https://boardgameguy.github.io/classProject/Imagees/battleship.jpg" alt="Battleship"></p>
<p>recommended ages: 8+</p>
<p>estimated play time: 30 Min</p>
<p>Game pieces include 2 portable battle cases, 10 plastic ships, 84 red 'hit' pegs, 
 and 168 white 'miss' pegs</p>
<p>This Battleship board game is the classic game of naval combat that brings together
  competition, strategy, and excitement! In head-to-head battle, 2 players search for 
  the enemy's fleet of ships and destroys them one by one. With convenient portable 
  battle cases and realistic looking naval crafts, the Battleship game puts players 
  right in the middle of the action. Players command a powerful fleet that includes an
  aircraft carrier, a destroyer, a submarine, a patrol boat, and a battleship. Each player
  announces the coordinates of each strike and sees if it hits. Position ships 
  strategically to survive an opponent's relentless strikes, and track hits and misses 
  with red and white pegs on the ocean grid. No ship is safe in this game of stealth 
  and suspense. Kids ages 7 and up can enjoy playing the Battleship classic board game.</p>
